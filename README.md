# [Luan's Portfolio](https://luancgs.dev/)

A simple portifolio to show case some of my skills as a developer. Also may serve as a _Curriculum Vitae_.

<hr>

## üß∞ Technologies

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run locally

First of all, you should clone this repo:

```sh
# Clone repo using ssh address
$ git clone git@github.com:luancgs/luancgs.github.io.git

# Enters repo directory
$ cd luancgs.github.io
```

If you have Docker installed, just do the following commands:

```sh
# Builds project docker image and runs it. It might take some time.
$ docker compose up -d
```

After that, you should access http://localhost:3000 to see the portfolio.

If you don't have docker or prefer to run using local node, simply do:

```sh
# Install node dependencies
$ yarn

# Run project in development mode
$ yarn start
```

In this case, you should still access http://localhost:3000 to see the portfolio.
